# Job Listing Portal

## Description
The Job Listing Portal is a web application built using Next.js with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS. This platform allows users to explore various job listings efficiently, thanks to the combination of server-side and client-side rendering for enhanced performance. Key features include:

- **Pagination**: Seamlessly browse through a large number of job listings with pagination.
- **Searchbar**: Easily search for jobs by title, company, or location.
- **Filters**: Narrow down job listings based on specific criteria like job type, salary range, and experience level.
